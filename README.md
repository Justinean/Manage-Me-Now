## Description
- We built this web application because we realized how difficult it is to manage a small group, let alone a large one. There are lots of ideas and to do lists flying around, so it makes sense to keep it all in one place. 
- This web application solves the problem of organizing your teams, projects, and tasks in a simple concise manner.
- We all learned a great deal about handlebars, servers, routes, javascript and bootstrap.
